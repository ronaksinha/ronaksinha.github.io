                            I attended Clovis North High School from 2012 to 2016. Clovis North is located in Fresno, California.

                        <p>During my time in high school, I had the opportunity to explore many different fields of studies. One of the most impactful programs I participated in was Science Olympiad. It was here where I discovered that I loved to create and build. A project that I believe really pushed me was called 
                            <a href="https://scioly.org/wiki/index.php/Robot_Arm"> Robot Arm</a>
                            as it required me to really understand the cooperation between hardware and software. This project had a signifiacnt impact on my decision to pursue a degree in Computer Engineering.

                            For college, I attended Purdue University from 2016 to 2021. Purdue is located in West Lafayette, Indiana. Here I pursued a degree in Computer Engineering while also achieving a certifacte for Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

                            My time at Purdue was filled with challenges and learning experiences. I had found high school relatively easy, however bringing that lackadaisical work ethic to college punished me. After my freshman year I looked back on why I struggled and what I could do to improve myself for the future semesters. I came to the conclusion that I needed to fix my time management, minimise my social life, and learn instead of study. After changing myself to fit my new standards, I was able to find success in my latter semesters.

                            Computer Engineering was not my initial goal. When I started college, I had the dream of one day working in the medical technology industry. Being inspired by my Science Olympiad projects in high school, I wanted to work on building prosthetics. However, I came into college with the wrong idea of how to get to this goal. I had initially applied to be a Biomedical Engineer. By my second year, after I had started my BioMedical Engineering (BME) courses, I realised that BME was not the right path. I decided to change my major (hence my 5 years instead of 4) to one that would get me into the medical side of engineering. I believed Computer Engineering would help me get there.
