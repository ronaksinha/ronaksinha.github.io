# Website

Personal portfolio website.

## Project structure

- `index.html`: primary landing page
- `pages/`: secondary pages and older standalone pages
- `assets/styles/`: site CSS
- `assets/scripts/`: site JavaScript
- `assets/images/`: image assets
- `fcf-assets/`: contact-form vendor assets (PHP, templates, JS/CSS)

## Notes

- Keep third-party/vendor code inside `fcf-assets/`.
- Prefer placing all new static assets under `assets/`.
- Keep page-to-page links in `pages/` relative (for example `education.html`).
