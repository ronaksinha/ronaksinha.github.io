                        I've primarily been doing back-end tasks working with tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, Postgresql, Visual Studio (C#), CodeFresh (CI/CD), Kafka, and Nifi. Over the past few months I've also been writing APIs, Integration Tests, and Unit Tests.

                        I began my third internship with Omnicell in May of 2020. This internship took place in the height of the pandemic and was therefore remote. Here I was working with report building tools such as Microsoft Report Builder (MSRB) and Tableau. 
                        
                    </p>
                    <p class="omnicell-desc">
                        Omnicell is a Microsoft based shop, so it only made sense at the time
                        to use MSRB for the report writing. The purpose of my role during this Internship was to make a decision on whether the company should keep using Microsoft Report Builder or to move on to a different report writing tool. 
                        I explored other report writing tools, but the only other one that made sense to use was Tableau. I spent a few weeks learning how to write reports using MSRB before exploring other options. When I began to use Tableau, I 
                        discovored that it was much easier to learn and had a much lower learning curve when compared to MSRB. The pros with Tableau were that the reports would be easier to be 
                        written and considering that there is a need for people with little coding experience to be using these tools, Tableau had the advantage. The only drawback to using Tableaue from MSRB was that MSRB offered a much deeper level 
                        of customization as it offered the report writer to go down to the code level to make adjustments. In the end, my reccomendation was to move on to Tableau.

                        a developerâ€™s web page in an efficient and error-free way. It was only succesfull because it was a special case since the specific web pages we were creating would certainly not change in resolution. I also gained experience in

                        I began my first internship with Omnicell in May of 2018. This internship took place in Cranberry, Pennsylvania. The title of my role was Controls Software Engineer. I was assigned to a team working with implementing and improving
                        robotic imaging on a large robot (XRT).

                        Here I created a Centroid Detection and Image Decimation program on Visual Studio in C# to increase image analysis performance speeds up to 2600% (1.3s to 0.05s). 
                        The logic behind the massive performance increase was that adding this preprocessing program decreased the resolution of the image while retaining enough information for a barcode scanning program to decode the barcode. 
                        I also implemented a program that would increase the clarity of the images for further analysis by implementing Convolution via Background Removal. 
                        Along with this, I did some other small projects such as providing theoretical solutions to further increase performance speeds and developing a program that can stitch multiple images together to create one large image (Auto Stitching Imaging), 
                        Through this internship I gained experience in Visual Studio, Matrox Imaging Library, Convolution, Image Decimation, Thresholding, BitMapSource, File Conversion, Directory Manipulation, and Image Stitching.
