    <p class="project-desc">The EPICS program (Engineering Projects in Community Service) is a service-learning design 
        program in which teams of students partner with local and global community organizations to address human, community, 
        and environmental needs. Here, I had the opportunity to work with the I2R (Innovation to Reality) team to encourage students
         from K-12 to consider becoming an engineer. Our team had a focus of making sure that all students felt like they belonged, 
         regardless of race, creed, color, or religion. Our team designed a hands-on learning activity that revolved around a theme
        of sustainability and promoted ideas of diminishing climate change. The experience was meant to not only be educational, but also
        fun and engaging. Guest speakers from the College of Agriculture were present and spoke about things we can all do to help reduce
        global warming</p>
